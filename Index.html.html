    <h2><b>EcoEclipse-Every Initiative Counts!</b></h2>
    <div class="first">
      <p><b>EcoEclipse</b> is an initiative for the implementation of 3R's i.e. REDUCE, REUSE, RECYCLE!
      We cannot stop waste production entirely, but everyone can make a significant contribution. Think before you bin! It saves energy and natural resources, helps to reduce pollution and reduces the need for landfill.<br>
      The 'Reduce', 'Reuse' and 'Recycle' elements are referred to as the '3 R's'
      Proper waste removal helps improve air and water quality as well as reduces greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
      It helps in minimising the extraction of resources along with reducing pollution and energy consumption which is associated with manufacturing new materials.<br>
      One of the most significant benefits of waste management is the protection of the environment and the health of the population.</p>

      <p>The total 5.4 crore MT of solid waste is generated annually, crore MT of garbage is unprocessed that craetes a filthy enviroment for Animals, humans and Society. <br>
      We have extracted everything from Our mother Earth, from our  existence to everything we need to exist.<br>
    humans are very adaptable  as we can still fix this mess but this opportunity to do so will not last for long so we must start today we have no more excusesbr
    As usual, Human's due to their greed of more and more, exploited and deteriorated our planet in the process of urbanisation and aggressive development.<br>
    humans are very adaptable  as we can still fix this mess but this opportunity to do so will not last for long, It's high time to stop talking and start doing things that'll make the world a better place to live.</p>

      <h1>A Word of Suggestion From Industry Experts </h1>
    </center>
    <font align="left" size=5>
      <b><p>REDUCE</p></b>
      </font>
    <p>Purchase only what food and other supplies you need. Purchasing less means you’ll have less to dispose of later. <br>
   Opt out of junk-mail by registering with the Direct Marketing Association.<br>
   Avoid creating trash whenever possible. When ordering food, don’t take any unnecessary plastic utensils, straws, etc. (ask in advance), don't accept "free" promotional products and buy products with the least amount of packaging.<br>
   Pack a waste-free lunch with no throwaway bags, containers, plastic wrap, etc. Use reusable containers to store food instead. <br>
  Avoid single-use items like juice boxes, soda bottles, paper dinnerware or plastic utensils. Buy cleaning supplies and other non-perishable materials in bulk to cut down on packaging.</p>
  <font align="left" size=5>
    <b><p>REUSE</p></b>
    </font>
    <p>Donate usable clothing, appliances, furniture and other items to nonprofits or secondhand stores in your area. <br>Not only will you reduce the amount of waste you produce, you’ll also help others in your community.<br>
    Switch from disposable to reusable items like plastic or metal food or beverage containers, refillable razors and pens, and washable kitchen towels and diapers. <br>
    When remodeling or making improvements to your home, donate usable items like cabinets, lighting, appliances, lumber, flooring and windows to construction resale shops.<br> Habitat Restores are a great option.
    Start a swap with your friends or coworkers to trade items like books, clothing, computer equipment and games. Something you’re no longer interested in could be a great find for a friend. <br>
    Bring your own shopping bags to the grocery store, mall and other stores.</p>
    <font align="left" size=5>
      <b><p>RECYCLE</p></b>
      </font>
    <p>Buy recycled paper and print on both sides. When using paper in the office, print on both sides of the sheet and recycle the paper when you are finished. <br>By recycling one ton of paper, you can save 17 trees, almost 7,000 gallons of water and more than three cubic yards of landfill space.<br>
    Recycle your outdated technology. According to EPA, Americans throw out two million tons of e-waste each year. Avoid adding to that waste by recycling your old technology.  <br>
    Make recycling bins readily available. <br>Make sure your home and office are outfitted with recycling bins for paper, plastic and metal. Keep them out in the open and label them appropriately. <br>Sometimes the convenience factor is all that is needed.
    Recycle your empty ink and toner cartridges. <br>Almost eight cartridges are thrown out in the United States every second of every day. That's almost 700,000 cartridges per day.<br>
    Buy remanufactured ink and toner cartridges.<br> Each remanufactured cartridge keeps approximately 2.5 pounds of metal and plastic out of landfills and saves about a half gallon of oil.
    Recycle old newspapers laying around the office. <br>When finished reading the newspaper, either leave it for someone else to read or recycle it.<br>
    Look for the recycled option in all the products you buy. It's not just paper that is recycled.</p>
